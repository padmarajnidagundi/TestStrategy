# Test Strategy

<b>What is Test strategy</b><p>
A test strategy is an outline that describes the testing approach of the software development cycle. It is created to inform project managers, testers, and developers about some key issues of the testing process. This includes the testing objective, methods of testing new functions, total time and resources required for the project, and the testing environment. ( Source - Wikipedia )

<b>What is Strategy</b><p>
Strategy (from Greek στρατηγία stratēgia, "art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship"[1]) is a high-level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty. ( Source - Wikipedia )

SMOKE TESTING, also known as “Build Verification Testing”, is a type of software testing that comprises of a non-exhaustive set of tests that aim at ensuring that the most important functions work - https://teststrategy.org/smoke-test-strategy/
<p>
Regression testing (rarely non-regression testing) is re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change. If not, that would be called a regression.  - https://teststrategy.org/regression-testing-strategy-online/
<p>
Performance testing is a testing measure that evaluates the speed, responsiveness and stability of a computer, network, software program or device under a workload. Organizations will run performance tests in order to identify performance-related bottlenecks. https://teststrategy.org/performance-testing-test-strategy/
<p>
 DevOps is all about streamlining and automating your entire software delivery lifecycle. For most organizations, a successful DevOps testing strategy starts with adopting the agile best practice of Continuous Integration (CI), where developers check code into a shared repository several times a day. https://teststrategy.org/devops-test-strategy/
  <p>
SECURITY TESTING is a type of software testing that intends to uncover vulnerabilities of the system and determine that its data and resources are protected from possible intruders. It falls under non-functional testing. ISTQB Definition. security testing: Testing to determine the security of the software product. https://teststrategy.org/security-test-strategy-template/
